As I think it's part of the job of an Artist to create Art for people to see and feel things they otherwise may not have experienced, & to open them up to an infinite world of life-changing possibilities; I also believe it's the DJ's job to play Music that moves people to open their hearts, minds, & bodies to Dance like nobody's watching & Love like they'll never get hurt. - We'll completely lose themselves in the Beats, the Bass, & the Bliss of Life.
